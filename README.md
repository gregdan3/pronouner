# pronouner
Generates pronoun candidates from given lists of consonants and vowels.

Has a curated starting point for the consonants and vowels to use, and pre-made
and justified blocklists for each.

## Setup
`make init` or `pdm install`

## Use
`make run` or `pdm run python ./pronouner.py`

## Why?
I wanted to pick up linguistics knowledge, and decided a fun side project to do
that would be to design and propose a singular, genderless, third person pronoun
to replace the use of singular "they" in English. This is entirely for fun!
